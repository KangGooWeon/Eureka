Micro service의 정의
Martin Folwer는 MSA에 대해 아래와 같이 설명하였습니다.

"the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery."
